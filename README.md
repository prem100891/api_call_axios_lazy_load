🛒 Lazy Loaded Product List App
This is a performance-optimized ReactJS application built as part of my refresher learning series. It showcases modern frontend best practices like lazy loading, code splitting, infinite scroll, API integration, and Material UI design.

🧠 Features Implemented
✨ Lazy Loading Components
→ Components are loaded on-demand using React.lazy() and Suspense to reduce initial bundle size.

🧩 Code Splitting
→ Route-based and component-level code splitting to enhance loading speed and performance.

🎨 Material UI Integration
→ Responsive UI built with MUI for a clean and modern look.

🌐 Axios for API Calls
→ Fetches dynamic product and category data with proper state handling and error fallback.

🧭 React Router Setup
→ Smooth navigation between Home and About pages using react-router-dom.

🔍 Search + Category Filter
→ Allows users to filter products by category and search by name with debounced input.

📜 Infinite Scroll
→ Products are auto-loaded as the user scrolls down, enhancing UX without page reloads or "Load More" buttons.

🚀 Deployed on Netlify with GitHub CI/CD
→ Integrated GitHub repo with Netlify for continuous deployment on every commit.
